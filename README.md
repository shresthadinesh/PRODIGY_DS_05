# Data Science Internship Task 5

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for **Task 5** of my Data Science internship at **Prodigy Info Tech**.

## Task Description
The main objective of this task is to **analyze traffic accident data** to identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. Additionally, I will **visualize accident hotspots** and explore the contributing factors.

## Dataset
I will use the **US Accident EDA dataset** from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [US Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)

## Expected Outcome
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key accident trends.  
- **Heatmaps and visualizations** of accident hotspots.  
- Insights into how **weather, road conditions, and time of day** impact accidents.  
- **Predictive modeling (if applicable)** to estimate accident risk based on conditions.
